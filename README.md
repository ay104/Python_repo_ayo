Python programming language was used to complete a project studying existing business data with the aim of gleaning patterns, insights and trend. Instacart's open source data sets (available @Kaggle and included in the folders uploaded into this repository) were prepared, combined and manipulated for insights on better customers understanding to aid improved targeting, sales revenue and bottom-line (CareeFoundry data analytics training project). Note: customers data and products prices used for this project were a fictitious creation of CareerFoundry to serve for learning purposes only.
### Context
Instacart is an online grocery distribution company based in the USA and services customers via orders logged on its app which are then delivered to the ordering customers. Instacart's stakeholders consisting of vice president of marketing, senior vice president of sales and the customers are thought of in this project to be interested in the variety of customers the company has and their purchasing behaviour. Instacart believes these customers can not be marketed via a one-size-fit-all approach and that compartible subgroups need to be identified so that appropriate marketing mix (solution) can be applied to each to experience how this approach impacts sales of individual products. I am thus employed as a data analyst to carry out analysis on available data, the result of which will contribute to the articulation of this differentiated marketing strategy. To this end, the stakeholders have the following questions which the analyses should answer.
#### Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
  day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
  times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
  spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
  these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
  use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
  and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
  product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
  customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
   - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
     often do they return to Instacart)?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
   - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
   - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
     habits?
   - What different classifcations does the demographic information suggest?
     Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
   - What differences can be found in ordering habits of different customer
     profiles considering the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
     customers are ordering, and anything else one can think of?
##### Analysis Criteria
- Project folder follows industry standards in terms of structure and naming
  conventions.
- Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries
  manager.
- Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os,
  matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
- All required libraries have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
- Python scripts are clean and easy to follow with headings and contents lists.
- All code is consistent (e.g., with the use of quotation marks and spaces) and includes
  descriptive comments.
- All required data sets have been successfully installed and imported into each script.
- Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data, such as checking
  the top and the bottom of the dataframe.
- Whenever a dataframe is altered, checks have been conducted to determine its
  shape and basic statistics.
- All project data has been merged into a single data set. A frequency of the merge fag
  shows the merged data set is a 100% match to the combined original data sets.
- Merged data set only contains variables to be used in the analysis.
- All column names are self-explanatory.
- All identifer variables follow the industry standard data type.
- Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have
  been checked and addressed.
- Samples have been exported whenever an exclusions fag has been created.
- All subsamples have been exported and saved in the proper folder following a
  consistent naming convention.
- Any new columns that have been derived are relevant to the needs of the analysis.
- At least 4 types of data visualizations have been generated to communicate insights
  to stakeholders. Visualizations are clearly labeled.
- Data ethics have been kept in mind when dealing with data, especially in regards to
  customer information.
- Final report includes evidence of analysis methodology, clear answers to the
  questions in this brief, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
- Final report contains data citation for Instacart and customer data sets.
###### Datasets
- As said earlier in this README overview, products dataset and orders dataset are open-source and available from Kaggle: [“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping
Dataset 2017”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)
- Customers and pricing datasets are property of CareerFoundry: these datasets are available in the uploaded folders.
